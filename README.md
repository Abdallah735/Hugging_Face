# 🖼️ AI-Powered Image Captioning & Speech Translation

## 📌 Project Overview
This project utilizes **Hugging Face models** to generate image captions, translate them into different languages, and convert the translated text into speech. It combines **computer vision, natural language processing, and speech synthesis** into a seamless pipeline.

## 🚀 Features
- 🏞️ **Image Captioning**: Generates descriptive captions for input images.
- 🌍 **Language Translation**: Translates captions into a target language.
- 🔊 **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Converts translated text into speech output.
- 📡 **Hugging Face API**: Uses pre-trained models for efficient processing.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- **Deep Learning Models:** Hugging Face Transformers (Vision & NLP)
- **Frameworks:** PyTorch / TensorFlow
- **APIs & Libraries:** Transformers, OpenCV, gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech)
- **Deployment:** Flask / FastAPI (if applicable)

## 🔍 How It Works
1. **Image Captioning**: 
   - An image is fed into a pre-trained vision-language model (e.g., BLIP, OFA, or ViT+GPT2).
   - The model generates a textual description of the image.
2. **Translation**:
   - The caption is passed to a language translation model (e.g., mBART, MarianMT) to convert it into the desired language.
3. **Text-to-Speech Conversion**:
   - The translated text is processed using a TTS model (e.g., Tacotron, gTTS, or Coqui TTS) to generate an audio output.
